Project Overview

This project is perfect for beginners who want to understand how AI/ML models work.
It covers everything from data preparation to model training, evaluation, and prediction.

The main objective is to develop a model that can accurately estimate the price of a house based on real-world factors.


Features

✔ Beginner-friendly
✔ Uses Linear Regression
✔ Clean and simple dataset
✔ Easy-to-understand code
✔ Predicts house price for new inputs
✔ Shows model accuracy using Mean Squared Error (MSE)


Tech Stack

Python

Pandas – Data handling

NumPy – Numerical operations

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Scikit-Learn – Machine learning algorithm



Dataset

The dataset contains the following features:

Feature	Description
Area	Size of the house in square feet
Bedrooms	Number of bedrooms
Age	Age of the house in years
Price	House price (target)


How the Model Works

Load the dataset

Prepare features (X) and target (y)

Split data into Train and Test sets

Train the model using Linear Regression

Predict values for test data

Evaluate model using MSE

Predict price for new house input
